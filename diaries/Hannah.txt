Week One
  I met my team and chose our project topic which is the Eatery Management System. We chose a scrum master and discussed our prefered roles, I chose to work on front-end as that
  is where I feel most comfortable. We also discussed the tools we could/will use for our project development.

Week Two
  We got started defining our user stories and setting up our proposal document. I wrote the 'existing systems and drawbacks' section of our proposal. This involved signing up for
  the two similar websites and mock using them as both customers and restaurants (where possible).

Week Three
  We worked on our proposal, refining our user stories and deciding on novel functionality. I made the story boards for our user stories, and in the process found a number of missing
  or redundant user stories to add/remove. I then wrote up the descriptions of the story boards and split the overview storyboard into sections based on the functionality categories.
