Overview: SocialSavour is an application that aims to connect eateries with their customers by blending the themes found in conventional eatery applications such as Uber Eats with those found in social applications such as Instagram. Such a platform helps restaurants socialize and market their business to their consumers using a medium that purely serves their interests as active participants in the dining industry.
